# PrimePatcher [PATCHED]

This needs to be compiled to a DLL and injected into CS:GO using a DLL injector, any of the injection methods should work: LoadLib, ManualMapping ( haven't tried )

This is 100% just visual, though its not client sided.
Using this you can fool players into believing you are prime/PRIME ENABLED when you are NOT.
If you are in a lobby with all prime playrs and you are using this the lobby will appear as PRIME ENABLED but you will be queued or a NON PRIME match.
